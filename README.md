# FergusonIAdding2NumbersEndPoints


This Program will be run through an API (PostMan) the user will input our local host URL For Example(https://localhost:7212/) After the URL type in AddingNumber/Adding/ 
after(type in 1 integer and then a second integer Ex. https://localhost:7212/AddingNumber/Adding/5/4. 
The program will then total the sum of those numbers.

//Reviewed by: Pedro Castaneda - Isaiah did a great job setting his Endpoint for adding two numbers. Number validation works great and I like the conversion from string to int inside of his function as well as the simplicity of his IF and ELSE statements. Great work!
